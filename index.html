    <h2>About Me</h2><h3>My name is Niko Farrell. I'm 21 years old and live in Chicago Illinois. In my freetime I often enjoy going 
        on long walks and taking nice bikerides around the city and on the lake. I enjoy playing sports like basketball, baseball, and football though im not 
        that much of a fan when it comes to watching sports.

    <h3>I'm also very fluent in many video games that I like to play in my freetime. From Smash Bros to Mortal Combat,
        Mario, Apex, COD, Minecraft, there is much gaming experience under my belt.

    <h3>From 2010-2017 I was in a program called destination imagination where we worked in groups to complete various
        challenges. Some of these challenges were structual, while others were more improv baised. 
        Teams around the world would gather for the global competition after regionals and state tourmenets. 
        The challenges I was involved in were primarily a mix of structural building challenges and improv challenges.
        This taught me a lot of good hard working skills that I still use to this day.
