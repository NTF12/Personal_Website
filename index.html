    <h2>About Me</h2><h3>My name is Niko Farrell. I'm 21 years old and live in Chicago Illinois. In my freetime I often enjoy going 
        on long walks or taking nice bikerides around the city and on the lake. I enjoy playing sports like basketball, baseball, and football though im not 
        that much of a fan when it comes to watching sports. I've always lived breathed and devoured technology all my life.
        I really like what tech has to bring to the world and I'm fascinated by the countless ways it can be utilized in every day life.
        My dream is to work in the luxurious hands of Google. I wish to help them with website development and other coding matters.

    <h3>I'm also very fluent in many video games that I like to play in my freetime. From Smash Bros to Mortal Combat,
        Mario, Apex, COD, Minecraft, there is much gaming experience under my belt. At a time I would enter tournments 
        in gaming to win prizes and cool rewards. These tourmenets took place at Ignite gaming lounge. There were many 
        valent opponents in these competition and it always kept me on my toes. I believe gaming has greatly improved my
        reflexes and focus.

    <h3>From 2010-2017 I was in a program called destination imagination where we worked in groups to complete various
        challenges. Some of these challenges were structual, while others were more improv baised. 
        Teams around the world would gather for the global competition after regionals and state tourmenets. 
        The challenges I was involved in were primarily a mix of structural building challenges and improv challenges.
        This taught me a lot of hard working and teamwork skills that I still use to this day.
