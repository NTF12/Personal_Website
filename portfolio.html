    <h2>Project One</h2>

    <H3>In this project I worked to code my own website. This took
        place on a html file in Visual Studio Code. I used a css file to
        style my website. I also created links on my html page to
        send people visiting my website to different pages.
    </H3>

    <h2>Project Two</h2>

    <h3>In this project I created different images in Visual Studio Code.
        These images took place on a website with various other 
        information about my life and my achievments. Overall the 
        project was a great learning experience and wasn't too difficult.
