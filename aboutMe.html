    <h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>
    <h3>I graduated highschool at Wolcott School in 2020. I have some 
        brief coding experience from that school. We learned about Python language and a few other minor coding languages.
        I worked through a program called After School Matters from 2016-2018 where I was trained to work with audio electronics.
        There I learned a lot about electronic components, circuitry and soldering. I've 
        worked a couple jobs at restaurants like Jason's Deli and Chick fil a and both of those 
        jobs really helped reinforce what it means to be a team member for me.
